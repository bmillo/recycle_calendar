================

This project is an exmaple of an REST-Api Server and seperated Client server written in NodeJS.

This setup should use a very minimum of node modules to get started with a tested API. Since the API will get request from other Clients, CORS is activated.

The Client is a simple Angular page (slightly edited from the seed project) that interacts with the Server (JSON).
